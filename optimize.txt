# Optimizations Made to Interface.py

## 1. Code Quality and Maintainability Improvements

### Defined Constants
- Added constants for partition table prefixes (RANGE_TABLE_PREFIX, RROBIN_TABLE_PREFIX)
- Added MAX_RATING constant (5.0) to replace hardcoded value
- This improves maintainability by centralizing these values

### F-string Usage 
- Replaced string concatenation with f-strings for better readability and performance
- For example, replaced `table_name = RANGE_TABLE_PREFIX + str(i)` with `table_name = f"{RANGE_TABLE_PREFIX}{i}"`

## 2. SQL Injection Prevention

### Parameterized Queries
- Replaced string concatenation in SQL queries with parameterized queries
- Example: `"INSERT INTO {table_name} VALUES (%s, %s, %s)", (userid, itemid, rating)`
- This prevents SQL injection attacks and improves security

## 3. Database Connection Management

### Better Connection Handling
- Used `openconnection` directly instead of reassigning to `con`
- Proper cursor management with `finally` blocks to ensure cursors are always closed
- Added transaction management (commit/rollback) within try-except blocks

## 4. Error Handling

### Exception Handling
- Added try-except-finally blocks around database operations
- Added transaction rollback on exceptions
- Re-raises exceptions after rollback to maintain error visibility
- This ensures database consistency in case of failures

## 5. Query Performance Improvements

### Round Robin Partitioning Optimization
- Instead of executing a separate query for each row, now fetches all rows once
- Uses batched inserts with mogrify for better performance
- This reduces database round-trips and improves performance for large datasets

### CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS
- Added IF NOT EXISTS to prevent errors if tables already exist

## 6. SQL Style Consistency
- Used uppercase for SQL keywords (CREATE, INSERT, etc.)
- Standardized table/column naming conventions
- Improved query formatting for better readability

## 7. Transaction Management
- Ensured each function has proper transaction handling (commit/rollback)
- Each function now either completes entirely or rolls back completely (atomicity)

## 8. Code Structure
- Added comments to clarify code sections
- Improved variable naming (min_range instead of minRange)
- Better organization of operations within functions
